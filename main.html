				<p>A toast sandwich is a sandwich made by putting a thin slice of toast between two thin slices of bread with a layer of butter, and adding salt and pepper to taste. Its origins can be traced to the Victorian years.</p>

				<p>In November 2011 the toast sandwich was recreated by the Royal Society of Chemistry in a tasting almost 150 years after the release of Beeton's Book of Household Management. The society sought to revive the forgotten dish in wake of the Great Recession after finding the cost being as low as 7.5p per sandwich. They named it "the country's most economical lunch", and even offered &pound;200 to whoever could devise a cheaper meal. Due to an overabundance of submissions the offer was closed 7 days later, and the &pound;200 given to a randomly selected entrant.</p>

				<p>The toast sandwich is featured as a side dish for the main course item the "Mad Hatter's Tea Party (c. 1892)"; this "Tea Party" is a dish inspired by Alice in Wonderland served in celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal's restaurant The Fat Duck. The dish contains 12 toast sandwiches. According to American public radio station KCRW, Blumenthal's recipe for the toast sandwich involves bone marrow salad, egg yolk mustard, gastrique, mayonnaise, and tomato ketchup.</p>

				<p>Members of NPR's news panel game show Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! each tried the toast sandwich. Host Peter Sagal remarked "This is the culinary equivalent of a Rothko painting. Or it's like a sandwich by Marcel Duchamp! It questions the essence of sandwich and language both!" David Griner of American advertising trade publication Adweek reviewed Taco Bell's new "Dollar Cravings" value menu describing the "Cheese Roll-Up" as follows: "This is the toast sandwich of Taco Bell cuisine." The A.V. Club's Mike Vago described it as an "extravagance of blandness." The Daily Meal remarked in their article "12 Life-Changing Sandwiches You've Never Heard Of", the toast sandwich was "just not that good. In Britain, for example, there's actually something called a toast sandwich, which is just buttered toast between two slices of bread. Thankfully, the Dadaists didn't invent any more sandwiches after that." The toast sandwich was discussed on The Leonard Lopate Show in an interview with The Sporkful's Dan Pashman. Host Leonard Lopate commented "it sounds weird to me."</p>

				<p>A recipe for the toast sandwich is available in the in the 1861 <a href="http://www.exclassics.com/beeton/beetpdf1.pdf">Book of Household Management by Isabella Beeton.</a></p>
